# File management and directories

You will interact with the unix sytem via special program called *shell*. You type commands to the shell which are send to the operating system.

Commands are composed of two parts: the name of the command itself and arguments. Certain arguments, called options (usually introduced by the "-" character), alter the behavior of the command in a particular way while other arguments specify the entities upon which the command operates (e.g., names of files, computers, users). In the following example:


## Directories


## Moving around the file system with cd

## Listing directory contents

## Moving, renaming and copying files
