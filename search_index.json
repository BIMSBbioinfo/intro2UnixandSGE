option to qsub tells Grid Engine that the job should be executed in the same directory that qsub was called The last argument to qsub is the command to be executed or script to be run The qsub command

the Max cluster environment is similar to using GNULinux environments for your job submission eg running your scripts or other software The difference is that you need to specify needed resources beforehand The cluster is controlled by the Grid Engine scheduler that organizes the queues and resources This sort of scheduling system is necessary when limited computational resources are shared by many And it would be useful if you are running alignments for multiple samples and want to distribute those tasks jobs across multiple machines or CPUs or when running statistical simulations that needs to run on multiple CPUs for a long time For these cases and many more alike you just need to submit your job script which is a shell script and Grid Engine will take care of the rest as long as there is no error in your script  Grid Engine will do the job scheduling That means you can submit all your jobs and Grid Engine will queue them and run them when resources you requested becomes available It will also achieve load balancing where the jobs will be distributed so that specific nodes do not get overloaded In addition Grid Engine will allow you to do job monitoring and accounting which will be useful when you want to check if your job is running and if it failed it will help you understand what went wrong  Within the next sections we will show how to use Grid Engine for job

file1 into subdirectory opt in your home directory  Finding files There are a couple of ways you can find files in your file system We will show the find command it works in the following syntax find directory name targetfile It is useful when you have a rough idea about file location  The following finds all files ending in html under homeuser directory  find homeuser name html  find can also do more than just finding files It also execute commands on the files you find via exec option The following command finds all files in the current directory with txt ending and counts the number of lines in every text file The is replaced by the name of each file found and the ends the exec clause  find name txt exec wc l  Another command that can find files is locate The locate command provides a faster way of locating all files whose names match a particular search string For example  locate txt  will find all filenames in the filesystem that contain txt anywhere in their full paths  A disadvantage of locate is that it stores all filenames on the system in an index that is usually updated only once a day This means locate will not find files that have been created very recently  Searching the contents of a text file Often times you would need search a file for existence of certain characters or words Imagine that you need to find gene ids in a text file containing some scores and gene ids you would like to get the lines that contains your gene id of interest This is similar to find functions in modern text processors such as MS Word This can be achieved via grep commmand Syntax of the command is grep options pattern files  Command Explanation  grep id1 genestxt searches and prints lines matching id1 in genestxt grep id1 txt searches and prints lines matching id1 in files ending with txt grep vi id1 txt similar to above but i option ignores the case Id1ID1iD1 and id1 treated equally v option prints lines that dont match the pattern  using grep and find together You can search all files in an entire directory tree for a particular pattern by combining grep and find The following command prints lines containing genes string from the files find name txt print found       grep genes find  name txt print  The search patterns that grep uses are a special named regular expressions You can have more comlicated searches using regular expressions but that is more of an advanced application See for more on that  See disk usage and free disk space with du and df  Deleting files and directories Use these with

shell script A shell script is a text file with a list of shell commands and it is executed like a program to perform a task or a set of tasks The primary aim of a shell script is to automate tasks and save time It is important to understand basic structure of a shell script since it is you interact with a computing clusters via shell scripts See next chapter on Grid Engine  what is Bash There are many different shells available in Unixlike systems The Bourne Again Shell Bash is one of them it is the default shell on GNULinux systems It has some advantages to other shells and is pretty much the standard shell and we will show how to use it for scripting below  Writing a simple bash shell script A basic shell script is just a series of commands That is what we will show next  Let us write a simple script that outputs hello world on the screen using the echo command We will save the text file as myScriptsh  binbash echo Hello World  executing a shell script syntaxbash yourscriptname In our case we write  bash myScriptsh Hello World  more complicated example Lets write a bit more complicated script using more of the shell commands The script uses the ls to list the files and uses wc l command which counts number of lines in a given file or standard input In this case wc l counts the number of lines in the output of ls l All this achieved by using pipe  contents of scriptsh  binbash echo here are the list of files ls l  echo The number of files ls l wc l  We can execute it as follows  bash scriptsh  variables in bash scripts You can also use variables in bash scripts Which are useful to capture the output of intermediate commands and use them to run other commandsThere are no data types for variables A variable in bash can contain any of the following a number a character or a string of characters  You do not need to declare a variable just assigning a value to its reference will create it  Now we will create a simple script with one variable We will assign Hello world string to that variable and print that variable with echo  binbash VARHello world  echo VAR  When assigning the variable we did not use the sign but when using the variable we had to use the sign  command line arguments in bash scripts The script can also take command line arguments Here we modify the script that lists the file to take a command line argument The argument will be a path to a directory  contents of script2sh  binbash VAR1 echo here are the list of files ls l VAR  echo The number of files ls l VAR wc l  Here is how you run the script  bash script2sh homeuserproject  The arguments are stored in variables with a number in the order of the argument starting at 1 First Argument 1 Second Argument 2 and so on  In the our case 1 corresponds to homeuserproject  Arithmetic operations bash scripts Arithmetic operations on integers in bash are done in the following format  binbash x6 y2 10 5 xy  echo xy echo 105  You can also copy paste these commands to the console to see how they work The echo commands should output 4 and 5  Bash arithmetic does not support floating points eg 13 1 operation will not work in bash you need to use bc command See this stackOverflow examplehttpstackoverflowcomquestions12147040divisioninscriptandfloatingpoint for an example on how to use bc  Looping over files If you are trying to automate a task using bash scripting it is very likely you will have to apply certain commands on each file in a directory This could be achieved with wild character and for loops The following script stores all the txt files in pathto directory in FILES variable Then for each file it calculates number of lines and outputs that with wc l command  binbash FILESpathtotxt for f in FILES do echo Processing f file count number of lines and output that for file f wc l f done  More on bash scripts You can write even more complicated shell scripts using control structures ifelse forwhile loops and achieve a lot just using the shell scripting but that is beyond the scope of the document See the links below if you want to get better at writing shell scripts  httpwwwfreeoscomguideslsst

most effective way to interact with a Unixlike system is through a special programme called shell A shell can be used interactively as a command line interface or as a batch processor  In the following screenshot you can see what a shell environment looks like on MacOS You see four terminal windows in a graphical user interface running different shells a descendent of the original shell sh and tcsh  althttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediaen88cTcshAndShScreenCapturepng  In this tutorial we assume that the popular GNU shell bash is used instead  What is GNU  According to the GNU websitehttpgnuorg  GNU is a Unixlike operating system that is free softwareit respects your freedom You can install versions of GNU more precisely GNULinux systems which are entirely free software  The GNU Project was launched in 1984 to develop the GNU system The name “GNU” is a recursive acronym for “GNUs Not Unix”  Although GNU is by its own admission not Unix the GNU system is one of the most popular modern implementations of a Unixlike system Many of the GNU applications including the bash shell are available for other operating systems as well  Starting a shell session  We highly recommended that a Unixlike system be used for this course If this is not an option for you and you are tied to Microsoft Windows you should install CygwinhttpenwikipediaorgwikiCygwin a Unixlike environment for Windows If you have remote access to a system running a Unixlike operating system such as GNULinux it may be sufficient to install PuTTYhttpenwikipediaorgwikiPuTTY a terminal application for accessing remote systems over the SSH protocol Many Windows users use PuTTY to connect to remote servers such as the login node of a cluster  Lets start a shell session  In Mac OS X go to utilities and start terminal In Windows open the Cygwin terminal or use PuTTY to connect to a remote Unix host If you are using GNULinux start your preferred terminal application eg xterm urxvt konsole terminal etc  What are commands  The shell interprets text as commands In interactive mode the user inputs text commands on the command line prompt and submits them for processing the shell reads from the standard input stream connected to the keyboard In batch processing mode on the other hand the shell reads commands from a specified file called a script By default the shell is configured to print all potential output of the commands to the screen  Any command line consists of one or more words the first word is the name of the command itself whereas anything that follows belongs to the arguments to the command  Arguments are passed to the command They can be switches or options indicated by the prefix to modify the behaviour of the command patterns the names of files to operate on etc The meaning of the arguments depends on the command  The below example shows the ls command which lists the files in a given directory without any arguments and run with the l option The stands for the shell prompt and is not part of the command  ls Documents  ls l total 0 drwxrxrx 22 root staff 748 May 26 1908 Documents  As you can see the l option changed the output of the ls command  Getting help  Man pages Type man commandName such as man ls this will return the manual page on the given command Most unix commands have extensive explanations and examples on those pages Type q on your keyboard to quit the manual view Info manuals All GNU software comes with extensive manuals called info pages You can read them with the info programme on the command line or from within Emacs Type info ls for the ls manual page The info pages are hypertext documents with a hierarchical structure and links When in info type H to learn how to use info To open info documentation inside of Emacs issue the command Ctrlh i Web search Search online for the command followed by unix or linux this will usually return forums and webpages about the command Look for example usage and

local resources an input stream may just as well be connected to an input source on the network and write to an output stream on a different machine This feature can be used to start a shell session on a network host provided that it accepts such connections  Nowadays for security reasons plain connections to remote machines are usually no longer used for shell sessions Instead an encrypted connection is negotiated before the shell session is started The most commonly used way to achieve this is the Secure Shell protocol or short SSH When a remote host eg the login node of a cluster listens for SSH connections commonly on network port 22 and you have credentials to authenticate on the remote host you can connect to the remote and start a shell session there This means you can start a shell session on a remote computer and use the filesystem and resources on that computer  To establish a connection to the remote host remotehostnet and authenticate as user username execute the following command in a regular shell session      ssh usernameremotehostnet  Dependent on the authentication method you may be asked for the password for username on the remote machine before you are admitted You should have a user account on the remote machine to be able to use this Ask the remote machines system administrator if you do not have an account  The very first time you connect to a remote machine you will be asked if you wish to add the remote host to a list of known hosts looking something like this  The authenticity of host remotehostnet2139122134 cant be established RSA key fingerprint is 53b4adc85117994bc908acc1b605719b Are you sure you want to continue connecting yesno  You are asked to confirm your intention to connect because SSH cannot guarantee that the remote host is really the host you intend to connect to it simply has never encounter this host before so it cannot validate the fingerprint against a record from a previous connection The only way to be sure that the machine is indeed the one you want to connect to is to compare the fingerprint manually but this is not feasible for people without physical access to the machine  When connecting to a cluster node on a local network you can be reasonably sure that the connection is safe Type yes and press enter to continue Your SSH client will record the fingerprint for this host and prevent you from connecting to a host with the same name but a different fingerprint to prevent a maninthemiddle attack  Upon establishing a connection a shell session will be started Confirm that you are on a remote system by running hostname  X11 forwarding  This is a useful feature of SSH because it enables you to see windows and bitmap information on the remote host That means you can use programs with a userinterface and can see the visual output of your work such as R or matlab plots  To use this feature you need to use X or Y option with SHH See below      ssh X usernameremotehostcom  or      ssh Y usernameremotehostcom  You can check if X11 forwarding works by typing echo DISPLAY this should return something like localhost180 it should not return an empty string  To test if this is working run xeyes on the remote host A window should appear on your machine While the programme runs on the remote host the window contents are forwarded hence the name to your local machine This also works with more complicated applications but performance may be inadequate when doing this over a poor
